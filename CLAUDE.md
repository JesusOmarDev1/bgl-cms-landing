## Code Implementation Rules

### Code Quality

- Use early returns for better readability
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Prefix event handlers with "handle" (handleClick, handleKeyDown)
- Use const over function declarations: `const toggle = () => {}`
- Define types and interfaces when possible
- Implement proper accessibility features (tabindex, aria-label, keyboard events)

### Styling Guidelines

- Always use Tailwind classes for styling
- Avoid CSS files or inline styles
- Use conditional classes efficiently
- Follow shadcn/ui patterns for component styling
- Utilize custom design tokens and CSS variables

### Payload CMS Specific

- Use proper collection and field configurations
- Implement hooks for revalidation and data population
- Follow Payload v3 patterns for globals, collections, and plugins
- Use proper access control and authentication patterns
- Implement proper field validation and sanitization

### Next.js 15 Specific

- Leverage App Router architecture
- Use Server Components by default, Client Components when needed
- Implement proper data fetching patterns
- Follow Next.js 15 caching and optimization strategies
- Use Turbopack for development builds

## Project Structure & Architecture

- Follow Next.js App Router patterns with proper file organization
- Correctly determine when to use server vs. client components
- Implement proper API routes and middleware
- Use proper payload configuration with plugins and collections
- Follow modular architecture with utilities and hooks

## Response Protocol

1. If uncertain about correctness, state so explicitly
2. If you don't know something, admit it rather than guessing
3. Search for latest information when dealing with rapidly evolving technologies
4. Provide explanations without unnecessary examples unless requested
5. Stay on-point and avoid verbose explanations

## Knowledge Updates

When working with Next.js 15, Payload CMS v3, React 19, TailwindCSS v4, or other rapidly evolving technologies, search for the latest documentation and best practices to ensure accuracy and current implementation patterns.
